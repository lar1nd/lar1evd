1) Install port by downloading it from macports.org

2) Using port, install root with python to get pyroot.  This takes awhile:
    
    sudo port install root5 +python27

3) Make sure python27 from macports is your default python:
    
    sudo port select python python27

3) Get numpy with macports and make sure it works:
    
    sudo port install py27-numpy

    a) To verify it, open python and:
      
      import numpy
      print(numpy.__file__)

      If it's /System/Library/.... there is a problem that we need to fix:

      sudo mv /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth_backup

      For more information as to why you need to do this, check out (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23483763/how-to-make-macports-python-use-its-own-packages-over-another-installations)

4) Now that numpy is working we can gather up the rest of the dependancies:
  
    sudo port install py27-pyqt4
    (that will install qt4 automatically, takes some time)

    sudo port install py27-matplotlib
    sudo port install py27-scipy
    sudo port install py27-opengl
    sudo port install py27-pyqtgraph

5) Cython should have been installed as a dependancy to an earlier package.  You can activate it with port select:
    sudo port select cython cython27



Here's the condensed version you could copy and paste:

    sudo port install root5 +python27
    sudo port select python python27
    sudo port install py27-numpy
    sudo mv /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth_backup
    sudo port install py27-pyqt4
    sudo port install py27-matplotlib
    sudo port install py27-scipy
    sudo port install py27-opengl
    sudo port install py27-pyqtgraph
    sudo port select cython cython27
